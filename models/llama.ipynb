The text is \\\" To solve the problems of the data reliability for NAND flash storages, a variable-node-based belief-propagation with message pre-processing (VNBP-MP) decoding algorithm for binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is proposed. The major feature is that, by making use of the characteristics of the NAND flash channel, the proposed algorithm performs the message pre-processing (MP) scheme to effectively prevent the propagation of unreliable messages and speed up the propagation of reliable messages. Additionally, the VNBP-MP algorithm includes a treatment for oscillating variable nodes (VNs) to further accelerate decoding convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed VNBP-MP algorithm has a noticeable improvement in convergence speed without compromising the error-correction performance, compared with the existing algorithms.\\\"\"\n",

Firstly, the study has defined the existing typology of walkways in the campus then selected the worse type-with less protection from the sun-for further improvement. The methodological tools used in the study were: a field survey, illuminance meter, and an Integrated Environmental Solution Virtual Environment (IESVE) software packages. The questionnaire was used to understand the right feedback on the existing walkways. The lowest ranked satisfactions received from the respondents were from excessive brightness and temperature in the walkways. Thus, this paper proposes a successful envelope layout solution that provides better lighting levels and glare-free spaces. The Islamic style pattern used in the campus design was considered for the proposed simulations. Light meter was used to measure the existing illuminance levels in the corridors. Accordingly, four cases with several parameters such as the integration of shading elements: fully or partially, and vertically or horizontally in addition to the flooring materials were conducted in the simulation.

In the context of the interdisciplinary undergraduate program “User Experience Design” (tripartition of computer science, conception and design, and usability) at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt, we have developed a curriculum that addresses the challenges of pervasive computing. In this context, we have found that didactic concepts that focus on the holistic understanding of pervasive computing are particularly effective in inspiring students. In contrast to simply transferring information, we have found that a more interactive and participatory approach to teaching is more effective in helping students to understand the complexities of pervasive computing.

The proposed technique utilizes array signal processing techniques and employs phased arrays to enhance the performance of the network. One of the key challenges in WSNs is synchronization, which is addressed by the proposed technique through the use of dual-frequency PDoA. The technique enables accurate synchronization of the nodes, which results in improved beamforming performance. The proposed technique is evaluated through simulations, which show that the technique outperforms existing techniques in terms of coverage, signal to noise ratio, and energy efficiency. The results of the simulation study demonstrate that the proposed beamforming technique is an effective solution for enhancing the performance of WSNs and improving the accuracy of sensor systems.\",\n          \"This paper introduces the concept of one pixel attack as a means of fooling deep neural networks. Perturbation methods are utilized to modify the color values of a single pixel in an image, which can have a significant impact on the network's ability to correctly recognize the image. This technique highlights the importance of network robustness, as even a small change can greatly affect the results. The study focuses on image recognition tasks, where color analysis plays a crucial role. The effectiveness of one pixel attack is demonstrated through experiments on several popular benchmark datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10. It is recommended that future research continue to examine potential vulnerabilities of neural networks to such additives, and identify methods for improving network defenses against these types of attacks.\",\n          \"Finding the rising stars is an interesting problem and has been recently studied in various domains including academic networks. This study formulates the problem of rising stars prediction as a machine learning task. This approach involves applying classification models to categorize features as co-authors, authors, and venues. The effectiveness of this categorization strategy is empirically analyzed. To test this approach, data from Pakistani researchers retrieved from Web of Sciences between 2008 to 2014 was used. Feature sets were calculated and classification techniques applied to predict rising star researchers. The researchers predicted by the proposed method are compared with top researchers of Pakistan in 2016 and 2017. The proposed technique successfully solves the problem of finding rising star researchers in computer sciences based on the authors' contribution, mutual influence, and venue citations scores.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pred_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
